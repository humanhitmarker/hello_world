# hello_world
first
this is my first git. i am interested in getting into code again. i wish to develop software and get a new project. I can read code and now im learning to write it. i have experience with c, python, html/xml, css, c++/c#, lisp and erlang. though the experience is small i believe it is good to have exposure to as many programming languages as possible.i understand the difference between oop and functional programming. Just need to pick up the pace and create myself a portfolio.
